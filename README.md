# English/Spanish Translator in C++

This is a simple c++ project which was adapted from a student of mine. I went above and beyond to parse the given text file using python and then creating two parallel arrays to store them in dictionaries.

Afterwards, the c++ program takes in a word and searches linearly through the array and until it finds its match. If found it uses the same index number to output the given translation in spanish. 

I also played around with a makefile for the first time.
